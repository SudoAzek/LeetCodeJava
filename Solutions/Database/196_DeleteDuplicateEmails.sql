 Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest Id.
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |

Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
